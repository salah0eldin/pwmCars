PWM Simulation for Robotics Workshop

This project is a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) simulation designed for a robotics workshop aimed at children. The simulation demonstrates how PWM controls the speed of two cars moving at different speeds. It includes interactive controls for adjusting the cars' speeds, duty cycle, and frequency, providing a hands-on learning experience.

Features:
- Interactive Controls: Adjust car speeds, duty cycle, and frequency.
- Real-time Simulation: Visualize car movements based on PWM settings.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes with Bootstrap.
- Educational Tool: Ideal for teaching PWM concepts in robotics.

Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap for styling
- Font Awesome for icons

How to Use:
- Clone the repository.
- Open index.html in your browser.
- Use the controls to adjust the simulation parameters.
- Click 'Run' to start the simulation and 'Reset' to reset the settings.

Demo:
A live demo can be found here.
